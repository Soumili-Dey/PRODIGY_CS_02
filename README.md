# Image Encryption/Decryption Tool 🔒
**PRODIGY_CS_02** - My second cybersecurity internship task at Prodigy Infotech

## 📖 Overview
This Python script performs image encryption/decryption using pixel manipulation. It transforms images via XOR operations with a secret key, providing a basic yet effective method for securing visual data. The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

## ✨ Features
- XOR-based pixel manipulation for encryption/decryption
- Support for common image formats (JPG, PNG, BMP)
- Real-time preview of transformed images
- Automatic saving of processed images
- Simple command-line interface

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (`pip install Pillow`)

## 🚀 Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python pixel_manipulation.py
